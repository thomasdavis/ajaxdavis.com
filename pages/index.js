        <h2>Web Developer - Melbourne</h2>

        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>Web development is my work, hobby and philosophy.</p>

        <p>Currently I am working with a great team on a product called <a href="https://listium.com">Listium</a> in Collingwood, Melbourne. (We are hiring!)</p>

        <p>For several years I worked remotely at various companies in different roles. I was the late CTO of <a href="https://angel.co/earbits-yc-w11">Earbits</a>, an awesome company who graduated from Y Combinator in 2011. I've spent time brainstorming and implementing activism campaigns for <a href="https://eff.org">EFF</a> whose work and mission I greatly admire.</p>


        <p>After work, I habitually build and contribute to free and open source software projects. A lot of front end developers find convenience in using <a href="https://cdnjs.com">Cdnjs</a>, which as of late 2014 is used by millions of websites.</p>

        <p>Standards work isn't my forte, but I felt compelled to create <a href="https://jsonresume.org">JSON Resume</a>, a more user-friendly resume specification which thousands of developers have adopted.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I've also helped millions of website visitors to learn Backbone.js via my <a href="http://backbonetutorials.com">tutorials</a>.

        </p>
        <p>In what spare time I have left, I find solace in studying politics, philosophy and literature.
